# Implementation:

### Q) What libraries did you add to the frontend? What are they used for?

I build the frontend with ReactJS and add the following libraries:
* Material-Ui for the components such as Buttons, List and others
* Lodash for managing the data and kepp consistency, modularity, performance of the app.
* Axios to call the Api

### Q) What's the command to start the frontend application locally?

clone
cd frontend
yarn install or npm install
yarn start or npm start

### Q) What libraries did you add to the backend? What are they used for?

I use express as framework with the following libraries:
* Lodash for managing the data and kepp consistency, modularity, performance of the app.
* Axios to call the Api
* Nodemon to keep the server running and updated after each modification on the files.
* coinbase-pro to call the API of Coinbase

### Q) What's the command to start the backend application locally?

From the directory where you clone the project:

$ cd backend
$ yarn install
or
$ npm install
$ yarn run dev

Then open a browser and copy the following links ( you can change the amount value):

Task 1: http://localhost:4000/exchange-routing?amount=1
Task 2: http://localhost:4000/compare-exchanges?amount=1
Task 3: http://localhost:4000/compare-exchanges2?amount=1

# General:

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?

It's difficult to say, I need define a goal first. but propably I had time I would have started on the mobile app to show the crypocurrencies with a logic of the currencies that are going up ( I don't know the correct term) because probably those are the ones that people would like to buy.

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?

I don't have a favorite, I enjoyed doing all, because it the challenge was not anly in the technical it was also in the concepts and the understanding APIs that I didn't knew before.

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?

I think I spent the same time on each part, except for the databases that was the fastest. but where I struggle more was understanding the concepts of exchange, order book, etc. I'm still not sure if I undertsood everything correctly.

### Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing?If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.

I will leave this one for the next interview, if I'm lucky and I'm selected to the next step.
